# Homestead_Management_Tool
Python homestead management tool
# Project Description
- A GUI python program designed to provide the user with a GUI interface for 
managing weekly homesteading livestock tasks.  

- Project partially developed using AI, Chat GPT.

## *PROJECT OVERVIEW* 

• Project Name: [Homestead_Management_Tool]
• Project Owners:[Jonathan Georgiades] 
• Project Goal: [Provide a simplified interface for users to establish and track information related to livestock management] 
• Stakeholders: [Project Owners]

## *PROJECT BACKGROUND SCENARIO*

- A homesteader or small farm business owner requires a simplified and user-friendly GUI program that will track livestock information into a database. The program must be able to add or remove an animal by its identity number, track health issues, track the amount of feed consumed weekly, track animal products harvested weekly, and generate a record for an animal.

## *PROJECT PLAN*

- Creation of a GUI interface livestock management program.  The program will incorporate a livestock information database, from data derived from an user input; to create new objects. It will take inputs manually for animal information. A “push button” will prompt the user to input animal information and a "generate report" button will display output for an animal. The stretch goals for the project will be to involve other related information and/or services. At a minimum, the goals of the project will be to display the following concepts:

I. GUI interface (UX Design)

    1. Main Window 
      a. Program title 
      b. Layout: 
        i. Menu Bar 
          ii. A main display area, that shows add and remove animal button, and generate report button. 

    2. Design Responsiveness 
      a. GUI elements are adjusted to the proper window size.
    
    3. Implementation Ideas and Notes 
      a. Use error handling and logging. 
      b. Use data validation to ensure data integrity prior to processing any user inputs. 
      c. Utilize python libraries 

    - In general, the purpose of this program will be to provide a simple interface for users to establish and track the information related to homesteading.
